Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Textbook
--------

Hagelstein, Peter L., Stephen D. Senturia, and Terry P. Orlando. _Introduction to Applied Quantum and Statistical Physics_. New York, NY: Wiley, 2004. ISBN: 0471202762.

Homework
--------

There will be about ten homework sets and two quiz-completion exercises (see also Quizzes below). Homework due dates vary and are listed on the Schedule. You may use any resource available on the homework, including textbooks, and you may work with other students in developing both insight and answers. However, you are required to write up your own final solutions and MATLAB® codes. **Copying a solution from another student or from a previous problem solution is not permitted.** As a precaution against any misunderstanding, we suggest that if you learn the solution to a problem from another source, whether printed or human, you identify the source on your homework paper.

Quizzes
-------

There will be two one-hour quizzes in class.

Quiz Dates: Ses #16 and Ses #27.

One sheet of notes is permitted at the quizzes. After completing and turning in your Quiz paper, you will be given until the start of class on the Wednesday following the Quiz to write up complete Quiz solutions as a take-home exercise. Quiz grades will be computed as the average of your in-class score and your final completed score.

Final Exam
----------

There will be a 3 hour final exam.

Grading
-------

The instructors reserve the right to use judgment instead of formulae when assigning final grades.
